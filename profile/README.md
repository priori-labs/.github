# Unstructured Labs

We are a new research lab interested in the intersection of AI research and biological intelligence. Our initial research is primarily focused on characterizing the gap between human cognitive abilities and modern AI systems.

In particular, we believe there are many areas in which humans still dramatically outperform modern AI systems and that these areas are signposts pointing us in the direction of new ideas.

Scaling alone will not achieve AGI.

New research is needed.
